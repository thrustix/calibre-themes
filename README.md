calibre-themes

This is a repo where I'll dump my Calibre reader themes. I like 
to have a few options, so I'll post whatever alternatives I come up with.

solarized-dark.css and solarized-light.css are obvious,
nightly-solzd-dark.css is solarized-dark.css with black background and
lighter grey for \<body\> text.

## Installation

To use, just copy the contents of any of the css files into your calibre
ebook viewer settings. Just open up an ebook, click `preferences`, then 
the `user stylesheet` tab. Paste in the contents of the file. Then, just
save and admire how cool you are.
